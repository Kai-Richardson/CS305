CS 305 HW1 REPORT

1a. Meets all specifications.
1b. See sample_output.txt
1c. These are all tested by the main run_test() function.
2.
2a. You're just accessing the member variables, theres no need for pointers.
2b. Because your inventory variable is a pointer to the inventory, since you
make changes to it that you want to persist. Most of the methods inside of inventory.c
change the contents of the inventory struct, which is why we need a pointer.

4.
Well, C is not an OO language first off. C is platform dependent. Java has a
garbage collector. There's no threading in C. There's private members in Java.
Java's a much higher-level language than C. There's no preprocessor in Java.

4b.
They are both compiled languages. Most basic syntax is the same, such as comments,
for loops, and if statements. Java is part of the C family of languages so this
is to be expected.

5a.
Compiler Message -  What it means - How I resolved it

munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer - something went wrong in free() - going into
lab hours and figuring out it was an off-by-one error I spent 4 hours on.

Segmentation Fault - Bad memory accessing - meeting with Dr. Cenek and fixing an
issue in my item.h struct declerations.

5b.
According to my time tracker, I spent 8h and 42m. 6h 17m in C, with the rest being
things like make, the .pdf, and others. 2 hours and 40 minutes were spent on
inventory.c alone.

APPENDIX A:
I verify that the code and this write-up were authored by me.
I have documented the help I have received in comments in the code files.

APPENDIX B:
See attached code files.

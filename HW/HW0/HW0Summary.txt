1. (2 pts) Testing:
    I tested my program by progressively evaluating by changing code and compiling. I also utilized print statements at critical points in the code.
    There's one difference, my doubles have some floating point arithmetic differences. It could be fixed with the math round function.

2. (1 pt) Evaluation:
    It's reaable and easy to follow. I used spacing and indentation to improve readability.
    I further commented my code in places where intention might not be clear from reading it.

3. (3 pts) Questions:
    1a. Inventory@4aa298b7 and Inventory@7d4991ad

    1b. Inventory@4aa298b7 and Inventory@7d4991ad

    1c. I assume those are the hex memory addresses.

    2.
        Inventory[]: [gloves, hat, boots, skateboard, null, null, null, null, null, null]
        Stock[]: [10, 2, 0, 0, null, null, null, null, null, null]

    3a. Writing the whole thing, really. It just takes time.
    3b. 3 hours. I spent an additional hour debugging WSL timecode issues with installing OpenJDK.

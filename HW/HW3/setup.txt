/*
The file structure is a decimal value that is the maximum number (N) of
printers that the MOAP has. Followed by the list of N printers and their
print capacity (in pages per minute). Assume that at the start of the program
all printers are online. The rest of the lines in the file are print jobs with
the name and a number of pages the print job has. The jobs are distributed into
the printer queues in a round robin fashion.After the jobs are read in, the
program will hang on a command line to accept and process one of the user defined
commands.
